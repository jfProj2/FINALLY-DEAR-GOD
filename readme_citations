main.cpp
-----------------------

For this file there were no sources to cite. All code
and ideas were the product of my partner and myself.

**********************
methods1.h
-----------------------

This header file contained most of the behind-the-scenes
IO and error management.

The file_exists() method was aided by the folllowing website.

> https://techoverflow.net/2013/08/21/how-to-check-if-file-exists-using-stat/
------
The save_file() method had low-level IO flags that were found by
researching into the "man 2 open" document. Here is where we
learned about the different flags.

> http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html
-------

The load_file() method was already made by previous
work with Lab08's 'cat' function.
-------

The close_file() method was again borrowed from
our Lab08 implementation.
-------

The get_filename() method was of our design.
-------

*********************
methods2.h
---------------------

This header file contained all of methods that dealt with the runnning
and handling of the TUI during its operation.

The run_editor() function was the powerhouse for handling input
and generating the TUI from the ncurses library.

    For basic window setup.
> http://hughm.cs.ukzn.ac.za/~murrellh/os/notes/ncurses.html#window

  For color handling.
> http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/NCURSES-Programming-HOWTO/color.html

  For other ncurses commands used.
> http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/html_single/NCURSES-Programming-HOWTO/#INIT

-------

The data_to_screen() method simply took in data in the form
of a string and printed it to the edit window. This
method's implementation was borrowed from Lab08.
-------

The add_char() function is what handled the user input.
This was a product of ingenuity.
-------

The remove_char() was also a product of ingenuity.
-------

The print_line_nums() method was also self-made.
-------

****************************
methods3.h
---------------------------

This header file dealt with the various pop-up windows that dealt
with file IO, errors, and functionality.

The "#define ARRAY_SIZE(a) (sizeof(a) / sizeof(a[0]))" was
borrowed from here

> https://github.com/tony/NCURSES-Programming-HOWTO-examples/blob/
  master/17-menus/user-pointer.c
--------

The show_menu_window() method was designed to display a file menu
and show different options to choose from. Most of this code was
aquired and built off of from here also.

> https://github.com/tony/NCURSES-Programming-HOWTO-examples/blob/
  master/17-menus/user-pointer.c
---------

The show_error_window() method was essentially the same thing
as the show_menu_window() method but with different selections.
---------

The show_open_window() method used the same methods as the previous
two functions but also implemented a FORM object. The code for the
FORM was got from here.

> http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/NCURSES-Programming-HOWTO/forms.html
---------

The show_save_window() method used the same implementation as
the first two window methods.
---------

The show_saveas_window() method was a combination of the
show_save_window() and the show_open_window() function
capabilities.
----------

****************************
methods_main.h
----------------------------

This header file was just a place to put our
function prototypes for the project.
